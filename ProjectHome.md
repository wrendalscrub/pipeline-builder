PipelineBuilder is a Python-based framework for creating and using various types of genome analysis pipelines. It was designed to simplify new pipeline creation, and standardize an interface for pipeline use. Its basic principle is that all Pipelines can be divided into modular Steps, with each Step being its own separate executable.

PipelineBuilder is originally an in-house software for the Center for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto. As such it is currently hardcoded to work with their computing clusters SciNet and SCC.
