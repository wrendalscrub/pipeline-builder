1. MRESeq is ported to pipelinebuilder except for the last analysis step. There is a bug in the file resources/MREseq_offset_BAM2RE_coverage_tabix.R. The RE_Analysis step creates an sh script; Sumit Jobs qsubs the sh script, and analysis will fail with the following error: 
	"Error in sum(RE_overlaps) : invalid 'type' (list) of argument
         Calls: bedpe2REcvg
         Execution halted"
This error is produced in the qsub ".e####" files in $_OUT_DIR/JOBS_RE_analysis. 
YOU WILL NEED TO DEBUG THIS if you want the pipeline to perform any analysis on the MRESeq output.
It should be simple to debug by someone more experienced with R...


2. $BT_INDEXES (Bowtie Indexes) are large files and right now they are in hbabaran/spai accounts. YOU WILL NEED TO MAKE YOUR OWN DIRS and redirect these paths in config.yml. See the note in config.yml for details. Basically: download the files from ftp://ftp.ccb.jhu.edu/pub/data/bowtie2_indexes/ and sort them by genome name, eg hg19 or mm9. Like so: 
BT_INDEXES:~/bowtie_indexes/hg19/make_hg19.sh
