INFO:
	This is the PipelineBuilder version of MRESeq. It was tested on SciNet only. 

TODO:
	setWalltimes doesn't actually do anything; it should follow a math formula based on Ulises Schmill's graph (http://www.genomic-epiphany.ca/drupal-7.0/mreseq) but at the moment you can set it manually through arguments
	
	RE_Analysis fails because of a bug in resources/MREseq_offset_BAM2RE_coverage_tabix.R. The R script, when ran produces the following error: 
	"Error in sum(RE_overlaps) : invalid 'type' (list) of argument
	Calls: bedpe2REcvg
	Execution halted"
This error is produced in the qsub ".e####" files in $_OUT_DIR/JOBS_RE_analysis

DEPENDENCIES:
	$BT_INDEXES (Bowtie Indexes) are large files and right now they are in hbabaran/spai accounts. YOU WILL NEED TO MAKE YOUR OWN DIRS and redirect these paths in config.yml. See the note in config.yml for details 

	MRESeq requires R packages GenomicRanges and Rsamtools. 
	to install R package "GenomicRanges" within R:
		source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
		biocLite("GenomicRanges")
	to install R package "Rsamtools" within R: 
		biocLite("Rsamtools")

STEPS:
	Count FQ in Parallel
	set Walltimes
	Make FastQC Batch Script
	Make FastQC Trim MultiJob Script
	Make BT2 Aligner Script
	Make BAM Script
	Make RE Analysis Script
	Submit Jobs
