#summary This page describes PipelineBuilder: what it is, how to use it and how it works.

= Introduction =

PipelineBuilder is a framework for creating and using various types of genome analysis pipelines. It was designed to simplify new pipeline creation, and standardize an interface for pipeline use. Its basic principle is that all Pipelines can be divided into modular Steps, with each Step being its own separate executable.
